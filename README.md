## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## User Stories

1. As a person, so that I can use Instagram, I want to be able to sign-up to Instagram.
2. As a user of Instagram, so that I can access my account, I want to sign in to Instagram.
3. As a user of Instagram, so that I can ensure no one else uses my account, I want to able to sign out of it.
4. As a user of Instagram so that I can share my pictures, I want to be able to post them on my profile.
5. As a user of Instagram so that I can express my liking for a picture, I want to be able to like it.
6. As a user of Instagram so as to communicate what I think of a picture, I want to be able to comment on pictures.

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
